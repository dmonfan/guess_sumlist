# guess_sumlist
A game where you guess a list of numbers

The numbers 1-9 are listed then scrambled and hidden. The following sums are taken: entries 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, and entries (1,4,7), (2,5,8), and (3,6,9). From this you deduce the hidden list. Solutions are not unique but they will exhibit symmetry I believe.
